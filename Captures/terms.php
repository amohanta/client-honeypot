	<p>
		Date of Last Revision: October 4, 2010.<br />
		<br />
		<b>Statement of Rights and Responsibilities</b><br />
		<br />
		This Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (&quot;Statement&quot;) derives from the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/principles.php">Facebook Principles</a>, and governs our relationship with users and others who interact with Facebook. By using or accessing Facebook, you agree to this Statement.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<b>Privacy</b><br />
			<br />
			Your privacy is very important to us. We designed our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">Privacy Policy</a> to make important disclosures about how you can use Facebook to share with others and how we collect and can use your content and information.&nbsp; We encourage you to read the Privacy Policy, and to use it to help make informed decisions.</li>
		<li>
			<b>Sharing Your Content and Information</b><br />
			<br />
			You own all of the content and information you post on Facebook, and you can control how it is shared through your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/">privacy</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/editapps.php">application settings</a>. In addition:
			<ol>
				<li>
					For content that is covered by intellectual property rights, like photos and videos (&quot;IP content&quot;), you specifically give us the following permission, subject to your <a href="http://www.facebook.com/privacy/">privacy</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/editapps.php">application settings</a>: you grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you post on or in connection with Facebook (&quot;IP License&quot;). This IP License ends when you delete your IP content or your account unless your content has been shared with others, and they have not deleted it.</li>
				<li>
					When you delete IP content, it is deleted in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer. However, you understand that removed content may persist in backup copies for a reasonable period of time (but will not be available to others).</li>
				<li>
					When you use an application, your content and information is shared with the application.&nbsp; We require applications to respect your privacy, and your agreement with that application will control how the application can use, store, and transfer that content and information.&nbsp; (To learn more about Platform, read our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/policy.php">Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="http://developers.facebook.com/about">About Platform</a> page.)</li>
				<li>
					When you publish content or information using the &quot;everyone&quot; setting, it means that you are allowing everyone, including people off of Facebook, to access and use that information, and to associate it with you (i.e., your name and profile picture).</li>
				<li>
					We always appreciate your feedback or other suggestions about Facebook, but you understand that we may use them without any obligation to compensate you for them (just as you have no obligation to offer them).</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Safety</b><br />
			<br />
			We do our best to keep Facebook safe, but we cannot guarantee it. We need your help to do that, which includes the following commitments:
			<ol>
				<li>
					You will not send or otherwise post unauthorized commercial communications (such as spam) on Facebook.</li>
				<li>
					You will not collect users&#39; content or information, or otherwise access Facebook, using automated means (such as harvesting bots, robots, spiders, or scrapers) without our permission.</li>
				<li>
					You will not engage in unlawful multi-level marketing, such as a pyramid scheme, on Facebook.</li>
				<li>
					You will not upload viruses or other malicious code.</li>
				<li>
					You will not solicit login information or access an account belonging to someone else.</li>
				<li>
					You will not bully, intimidate, or harass any user.</li>
				<li>
					You will not post content that: is hateful, threatening, or pornographic; incites violence; or contains nudity or graphic or gratuitous violence.</li>
				<li>
					You will not develop or operate a third-party application containing alcohol-related or other mature content (including advertisements) without appropriate age-based restrictions.</li>
				<li>
					You will not offer any contest, giveaway, or sweepstakes (&quot;promotion&quot;) on Facebook without our prior written consent. If we consent, you take full responsibility for the promotion, and will follow our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/promotions_guidelines.php">Promotions Guidelines</a> and all applicable laws.</li>
				<li>
					You will not use Facebook to do anything unlawful, misleading, malicious, or discriminatory.</li>
				<li>
					You will not do anything that could disable, overburden, or impair the proper working of Facebook, such as a denial of service attack.</li>
				<li>
					You will not facilitate or encourage any violations of this Statement.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Registration and Account Security</b><br />
			<br />
			Facebook users provide their real names and information, and we need your help to keep it that way. Here are some commitments you make to us relating to registering and maintaining the security of your account:
			<ol>
				<li>
					You will not provide any false personal information on Facebook, or create an account for anyone other than yourself without permission.</li>
				<li>
					You will not create more than one personal profile.</li>
				<li>
					If we disable your account, you will not create another one without our permission.</li>
				<li>
					You will not use your personal profile for your own commercial gain (such as selling your status update to an advertiser).</li>
				<li>
					You will not use Facebook if you are under 13.</li>
				<li>
					You will not use Facebook if you are a convicted sex offender.</li>
				<li>
					You will keep your contact information accurate and up-to-date.</li>
				<li>
					You will not share your password, (or in the case of developers, your secret key), let anyone else access your account, or do anything else that might jeopardize the security of your account.</li>
				<li>
					You will not transfer your account (including any page or application you administer) to anyone without first getting our written permission.</li>
				<li>
					If you select a username for your account we reserve the right to remove or reclaim it if we believe appropriate (such as when a trademark owner complains about a username that does not closely relate to a user&#39;s actual name).</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Protecting Other People&#39;s Rights</b><br />
			<br />
			We respect other people&#39;s rights, and expect you to do the same.
			<ol>
				<li>
					You will not post content or take any action on Facebook that infringes or violates someone else&#39;s rights or otherwise violates the law.</li>
				<li>
					We can remove any content or information you post on Facebook if we believe that it violates this Statement.</li>
				<li>
					We will provide you with tools to help you protect your intellectual property rights. To learn more, visit our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/legal/copyright.php?howto_report">How to Report Claims of Intellectual Property Infringement</a> page.</li>
				<li>
					If we remove your content for infringing someone else&#39;s copyright, and you believe we removed it by mistake, we will provide you with an opportunity to appeal.</li>
				<li>
					If you repeatedly infringe other people&#39;s intellectual property rights, we will disable your account when appropriate.</li>
				<li>
					You will not use our copyrights or trademarks (including Facebook, the Facebook and F Logos, FB, Face, Poke, Wall and 32665), or any confusingly similar marks, without our written permission.</li>
				<li>
					If you collect information from users, you will: obtain their consent, make it clear you (and not Facebook) are the one collecting their information, and post a privacy policy explaining what information you collect and how you will use it.</li>
				<li>
					You will not post anyone&#39;s identification documents or sensitive financial information on Facebook.</li>
				<li>
					You will not tag users or send email invitations to non-users without their consent.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>
			<b>Mobile</b>
			<ol>
				<li>
					We currently provide our mobile services for free, but please be aware that your carrier&#39;s normal rates and fees, such as text messaging fees, will still apply.</li>
				<li>
					In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you will update your account information on Facebook within 48 hours to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person who acquires your old number.</li>
				<li>
					You provide all rights necessary to enable users to sync (including through an application) their contact lists with any basic information and contact information that is visible to them on Facebook, as well as your name and profile picture.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>

					If anyone brings a claim against us related to your actions, content or information on Facebook, you will indemnify and hold us harmless from and against all damages, losses, and expenses of any kind (including reasonable legal fees and costs) related to such claim.</li>
				<li>
					WE TRY TO KEEP FACEBOOK UP, BUG-FREE, AND SAFE, BUT YOU USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
